# ALX Software Engineering - 0x0A. C - argc, argv

This repository contains a collection of C programming tasks that cover the topic of program arguments, main function prototypes, understanding when to employ either form based on specific scenarios. Delve into advanced techniques, such as utilizing `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to optimize code compilation involving unused variables or parameters.
