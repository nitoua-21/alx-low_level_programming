# ALX Software Engineering - 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

This repository contains a collection of C programming tasks that cover the topic of nested loops and their applications, functions and their utilization, distinguish between function declarations and definitions, prototypes, variable scopes, elucidate the significance of GCC flags such as `-Wall`, `-Werror`, `-pedantic`, `-Wextra`, and `-std=gnu89`, and unravel the concept of header files and their seamless integration using the `#include` directive.

## Table of Contents

- [0-putchar.c](0-putchar.c):  a function prints _putchar, followed by a new line.
- [1-alphabet.c](1-alphabet.c): a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- [2-print_alphabet_x10.c](2-print_alphabet_x10.c): a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- [3-islower.c](3-islower.c): a function that checks for lowercase character.
- [4-isalpha.c](4-isalpha.c): a function that checks for alphabetic character.
- [5-sign.c](5-sign.c): a function that prints the sign of a number.
- [6-abs.c](6-abs.c): a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
- [7-print_last_digit.c](7-print_last_digit.c): a function that prints the last digit of a number.

- [100-times_table.c](100-times_table.c): a function that prints the `n` times table, starting with 0.
- [101-natural.c](101-natural.c): a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of `3` or `5` below `1024` (excluded), followed by a new line.
- [102-fibonacci.c](102-fibonacci.c): a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`, followed by a new line.
- [103-fibonacci.c](103-fibonacci.c): a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms  in the Fibonacci sequence, followed by a new line.
- [104-fibonacci.c](104-fibonacci.c): a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`, followed by a new line (The standard library and any other libraries should not be used, `long long`, `malloc`, pointers, arrays/tables, or structures should not be used).
