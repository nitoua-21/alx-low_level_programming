# ALX Software Engineering - 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

This repository contains a collection of C programming tasks that cover the topic of nested loops and their applications, functions and their utilization, distinguish between function declarations and definitions, prototypes, variable scopes, elucidate the significance of GCC flags such as `-Wall`, `-Werror`, `-pedantic`, `-Wextra`, and `-std=gnu89`, and unravel the concept of header files and their seamless integration using the `#include` directive.

## Table of Contents

- [0-isupper.c](0-isupper.c): a function that checks for uppercase character.
- [1-isdigit.c](1-isdigit.c): a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
- [2-mul.c](2-mul.c): a function that multiplies two integers.
- [3-print_numbers.c](3-print_numbers.c): a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.
- [4-print_most_numbers.c](4-print_most_numbers.c): a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.
- [5-more_numbers.c](5-more_numbers.c): a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line.
- [6-print_line.c](6-print_line.c): a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
- [7-print_diagonal.c](7-print_diagonal.c): a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
- [8-print_square.c](8-print_square.c): a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
- [9-fizz_buzz.c](9-fizz_buzz.c): a program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.
- [10-print_triangle.c](10-print_triangle.c): a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
- [100-prime_factor.c](100-prime_factor.c): a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143`, followed by a new line.
- [101-print_number.c](101-print_number.c): a function that prints an integer.
