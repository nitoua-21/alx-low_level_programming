# ALX SE - Introduction to C Programming Tasks

This repository contains solutions to programming tasks that offer an introduction to the C programming language. The tasks are designed to provide a foundational understanding of various concepts, including the C compilation process using GCC in a Linux environment, creating the classic "Hello World" program, and exploring the sizes of different variables.

## Table of Contents

- [0-preprocessor](0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor) : script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
- [1-compile](0x00-hello_world/1-compile): script that compiles a C file but does not link.
- [2-assembler](0x00-hello_world/2-assembler): script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
- [3-name](0x00-hello_world/3-name): script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`
- [4-puts.c](0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c): C program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line.
- [5-printf.c](0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c): C program that prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line.
- [6-size.c](0x00-hello_world/6-size.c): C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
- [100-intel](0x00-hello_world/100-intel): script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
- [101-quote.c](0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c): C program that prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
