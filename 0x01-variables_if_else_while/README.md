# ALX Sotware Engineering - 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

This repository contains a collection of programming tasks aimed at imparting foundational knowledge of the C programming language. The tasks cover a wide range of topics including arithmetic, logical, and relational operators, boolean values and operators, conditional statements (if, if...else), commenting, variable declaration and assignment, printing variables using printf, while loops, ASCII character set, and the purpose of `GCC` flags `-m32` and `-m64.`

## Table of contents

- [0-positive_or_negative.c](0-positive_or_negative.c): assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed.
- [1-last_digit.c](1-last_digit.c): assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed.
- [2-print_alphabet.c](2-print_alphabet.c): prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- [3-print_alphabets.c](3-print_alphabets.c): prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
- [4-print_alphabt.c](4-print_alphabt.c): that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- [5-print_numbers.c](5-print_numbers.c): prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
- [6-print_numberz.c](6-print_numberz.c): prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
- [7-print_tebahpla.c](7-print_tebahpla.c): prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
- [8-print_base16.c](8-print_base16.c): prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- [9-print_comb.c](9-print_comb.c): prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by `,`
- [100-print_comb3.c](100-print_comb3.c): prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
- [101-print_comb4.c](101-print_comb4.c): prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
- [102-print_comb5.c](102-print_comb5.c): prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
